# cement-bot
A slightly pointless bot for the KSU Cybersecurity Club Hub Discord server. I just want coding practice.

# Setup
- Create and invite a Discord application with the `bot` and `application.command` scopes
- Install Node.js
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install`
- Fill in values in config-sample.json and rename to config.json
- Run `node ./index.json`
